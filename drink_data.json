                "Tequila \u2013 or mezcal, or sotol\nBlanco (unaged) is most common and recommended, but reposado (aged under 1 year) is also often used, and a\u00f1ejo (aged 1 to 3 years) is sometimes used.[1] The issue is that tequila is the focus of the drink, and conversely the margarita is the most common tequila cocktail. Blanco is most assertive, and the purest expression of agave, while reposado is gentler and with somewhat less agave and a little wood (from oak); a\u00f1ejo has less agave taste and makes a very gentle margarita.\n100% agave is recommended, as it is the focus; mixto (less than 100% agave) is significantly cheaper, but of inferior quality. If cost is an issue or if very sugary, mixto may prove acceptable, though one should compare with 100% agave before serving.\nWidely varying grades of tequila are used in margaritas, from the cheapest grade to the fanciest. This significantly affects the quality and the cost, and comparison is strongly recommended.",
                "Orange liqueur\nTriple sec is most common, and cheap; brands vary in quality and price. Cointreau is a common substitute, and significantly more expensive, but considered by many to be far superior to triple sec. Grand Marnier is another well-respected orange liqueur, of similar quality and price to Cointreau, while Patr\u00f3n Citr\u00f3nge is a more recent addition, somewhat cheaper than both, and Gran Gala is an Italian version that is again somewhat cheaper. There are many alternatives for orange liqueur, some little-known and little-advertised; cura\u00e7aos may also be used.[2]\nIssues to consider in orange liqueur include: alcohol content \u2013 orange liqueurs vary in alcohol content from 15% to 40% (30 to 80 proof); neutral spirits base (such as Cointreau) or brandy base (such as Grand Marnier) \u2013 this affects taste and color; and price \u2013 generic triple sec adds negligibly to the price of a margarita (compared to tequila), while name brands can double the price.",
                "Citrus juice \u2013 or other fruit juice\nMost often fresh lime juice, ideally from key limes; Persian limes are most common in stores, however. One can also use other citrus such as lemon, or even others such as grapefruit, though this is properly a variant. One may even use other fruit juices (as is common in daquiris), though this should be flagged.\nFresh lime juice is strongly recommended, and considered a defining characteristic; one may use Rose\u2019s lime juice or sour mix, but this yields a significantly sweeter drink due to added sugar, and is considered deeply inferior.",
                "Salt\nGenerally coarse salt is used; one may also use fine salt, or various flavored salts or sugar (of various fineness) instead.",
                "Simple syrup\nSome serve sweet tequilas; this is most easily accomplished by using simple syrup, sour mix or pre-packaged \u201ctequila mixes\u201d. Sweet margaritas are looked down upon as \u201cparty drinks\u201d, and subtle details of the tequila or orange liqueur tend to be masked by the overwhelming sugar flavor, but they are widely served at parties."

                "Tequila \u2013 or mezcal, or sotol\nBlanco (unaged) is most common and recommended, but reposado (aged under 1 year) is also often used, and a\u00f1ejo (aged 1 to 3 years) is sometimes used.[1] The issue is that tequila is the focus of the drink, and conversely the margarita is the most common tequila cocktail. Blanco is most assertive, and the purest expression of agave, while reposado is gentler and with somewhat less agave and a little wood (from oak); a\u00f1ejo has less agave taste and makes a very gentle margarita.\n100% agave is recommended, as it is the focus; mixto (less than 100% agave) is significantly cheaper, but of inferior quality. If cost is an issue or if very sugary, mixto may prove acceptable, though one should compare with 100% agave before serving.\nWidely varying grades of tequila are used in margaritas, from the cheapest grade to the fanciest. This significantly affects the quality and the cost, and comparison is strongly recommended.",
                "Orange liqueur\nTriple sec is most common, and cheap; brands vary in quality and price. Cointreau is a common substitute, and significantly more expensive, but considered by many to be far superior to triple sec. Grand Marnier is another well-respected orange liqueur, of similar quality and price to Cointreau, while Patr\u00f3n Citr\u00f3nge is a more recent addition, somewhat cheaper than both, and Gran Gala is an Italian version that is again somewhat cheaper. There are many alternatives for orange liqueur, some little-known and little-advertised; cura\u00e7aos may also be used.[2]\nIssues to consider in orange liqueur include: alcohol content \u2013 orange liqueurs vary in alcohol content from 15% to 40% (30 to 80 proof); neutral spirits base (such as Cointreau) or brandy base (such as Grand Marnier) \u2013 this affects taste and color; and price \u2013 generic triple sec adds negligibly to the price of a margarita (compared to tequila), while name brands can double the price.",
                "Citrus juice \u2013 or other fruit juice\nMost often fresh lime juice, ideally from key limes; Persian limes are most common in stores, however. One can also use other citrus such as lemon, or even others such as grapefruit, though this is properly a variant. One may even use other fruit juices (as is common in daquiris), though this should be flagged.\nFresh lime juice is strongly recommended, and considered a defining characteristic; one may use Rose\u2019s lime juice or sour mix, but this yields a significantly sweeter drink due to added sugar, and is considered deeply inferior.",
                "Salt\nGenerally coarse salt is used; one may also use fine salt, or various flavored salts or sugar (of various fineness) instead.",
                "Simple syrup\nSome serve sweet tequilas; this is most easily accomplished by using simple syrup, sour mix or pre-packaged \u201ctequila mixes\u201d. Sweet margaritas are looked down upon as \u201cparty drinks\u201d, and subtle details of the tequila or orange liqueur tend to be masked by the overwhelming sugar flavor, but they are widely served at parties."
